DefaultOrder
============

The default_order plugin provides a 'order_by' method to
be called in your models.

ex : 

class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  order_by :fields => ['first_name', 'last_name'], :mode => :desc

end

# mode can be either a Symbol or a String
order_by :fields => ['first_name', 'last_name'], :mode => :desc
order_by :fields => ['first_name', 'last_name'], :mode => "DESC"

mode default to ASC

For compatibility with previous version you can use the string form
but it is not recommended

order_by "contacts.first_name, contacts.last_name DESC"

the order_by method will append the given argument to 
:order Hash key of ActiveRecord::Base.find method
IF IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED.

ex : 

Contact.find(:all, :conditions => "last_name LIKE '%toto%'")
# will act as if you had written this

Contact.find(:all, :order => "last_name, first_name",
	:conditions => "last_name LIKE '%toto%'")
# but if you provide :order it will override the default order
